## 4. User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic HTTP Metrics

**US-1.1**: As a backend developer, I want to add request duration tracking to my HTTP server with one line of code, so that I can monitor API performance without complex setup.
```go
mux.Handle("/api", metrics.RequestDurationHandler("v1.0", myHandler))
```

**US-1.2**: As an SRE, I want to see in-flight request counts, so that I can monitor server load and identify bottlenecks.

**US-1.3**: As a developer, I want to track response sizes by content type, so that I can optimize payload sizes and bandwidth usage.

### Epic 2: Service-Level Monitoring

**US-2.1**: As a service owner, I want to track RED metrics for my business operations, so that I can measure service quality and set SLOs.
```go
red := metrics.NewRED("user_service", "create_user")
defer red.Done()
// business logic
if err != nil {
    red.Fail()
}
```

**US-2.2**: As an SRE, I want automatic error detection based on HTTP status codes, so that I can set up alerts without manual error classification.

### Epic 3: Advanced Analytics

**US-3.1**: As a product manager, I want to see unique user counts per API endpoint, so that I can understand feature adoption without storing personal data.

**US-3.2**: As a data analyst, I want to see the top 10 most frequently called endpoints, so that I can prioritize optimization efforts.

**US-3.3**: As an SRE, I want to see latency percentiles (P50, P90, P95) for each endpoint, so that I can set appropriate SLA targets.

### Epic 4: Operations & Monitoring

**US-4.1**: As an SRE, I want pre-built Grafana dashboards, so that I can visualize application metrics without creating dashboards from scratch.

**US-4.2**: As a developer, I want metrics collection to never break my application, so that I can safely deploy instrumentation to production.

**US-4.3**: As an operations engineer, I want health check endpoints for the metrics system, so that I can monitor the monitoring infrastructure.

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1 API Design

#### Core Metrics API
```go
// Basic usage
metrics.InFlightGauge.Inc()
metrics.InFlightGauge.Dec()

// Request duration middleware
handler := metrics.RequestDurationHandler("v1.0", myHandler)

// Response size tracking
size := metrics.ObserveResponseSize(request)

// RED metrics
red := metrics.NewRED("service", "action")
defer red.Done()
```

#### Advanced Analytics API
```go
// Create tracker
tracker := metrics.NewTracker("api_analytics", redisClient)

// Record metrics
err := tracker.Record(ctx, path, userID, duration)

// Get statistics
stats, err := tracker.Stats(ctx, time.Now())
```

#### Configuration API
```go
// Custom configuration
config := metrics.MetricsConfig{
    EnableInFlight:     true,
    EnableDuration:     true,
    EnableResponseSize: true,
    Version:           "2.1.0",
    ServiceName:       "user-api",
}

handler := metrics.ConfigurableMiddleware(config, myHandler)
```

### 5.2 Data Models

    P95    float64  // 95th percentile latency
    Unique int64    // Unique users/sessions
    Total  int64    // Total request count
}

type REDConfig struct {
    Service            string
    Action             string
    DefaultStatus      string
    EnablePanicRecovery bool
}
```
